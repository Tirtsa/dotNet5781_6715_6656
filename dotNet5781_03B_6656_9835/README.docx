Assignment 3b by Rachel Wolfe 337816656 for Esther Parnes in Mini-Windows Project

I chose to use only BackgoundWorkers instead of threads because they allow for more
simple flow in sharing of infomation between the 'parent' and 'child' processes.
I added to bus information the option to add a bus driver's name from the bus's
information display window pop-up and the amount of seats on the bus
The travel distance pop-up field and the driver's name field are submitted using
the enter key (and then a button can be easily added in the code if needed)
Buses are color coded based on the status if they are free, traveling, refueling 
or in service are marked in green, orange, yellow and red respectively
Stay Healthy! :)
